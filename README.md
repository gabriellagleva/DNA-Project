# GUI-DNA-ANALYSIS


Hello, I am Gabe Lagleva. This was a simple project that I did to get a little bit more comfortant with Tkinter. Never done anything like this before, so it does have much to be desired. 
However, I'll be working on it periodically to make it a tad better each time. The idea comes from a my genetics class, where we needed to do a number of things to DNA like translate, compare, and other things. I basically said "I can automate that," so I did.
